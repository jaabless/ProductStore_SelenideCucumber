  Scenario: Add single product to cart
    Given the user is on the product detail page for "Sony vaio i5"
    When the user clicks "Add to cart"
    Then a confirmation should be shown
    And the cart should contain 1 item

    When the user goes to the cart page
    Then there should be 2 entries for "Sony vaio i5" in the cart
